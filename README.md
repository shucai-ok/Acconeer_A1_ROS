# Acconeer_A1_ROS
The Acconeer_A1_ROS package uses the Acconeer RSS library to operate the XC112 Radar Sensor and transmit the data produced from the envelope service.
The talker node is to be run in the catkin workspace of the RaspberryPi connected to the sensor. The topic_subscriber node is to be run on another device to print the envelope data.

Update: CMakelists bug unresolved
